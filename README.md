<h3>Gameplay</h3>

- The seven types of tetrominoes
The goal is to drop blocks, called tetrominos, down into a 10x20 block playing field to make horizontal lines. Tetriminos are made of four connected squares each. There are seven different types of tetrominos. Levels have a set goal, or number of lines to clear. When the goal number reaches zero, the player moves to the next level. As the levels go up, the tetrominos fall faster. A player receives bonus points if he can clear more than one line with a single tetromino. Clearing four lines is called a "tetris", three lines a "triple" and two lines a "double". Clearing two tetrises in a row is called a back-to-back tetris. The player can also turn a T-shaped tetromino into a hole, called a T-slot, to get more points. This move is called a "T-spin". In older versions of the game, the player loses when the tetrominos make it to the top of the playing field. In more modern versions of the game, the can lose in two ways. The first is when they place a piece completely above the playing field. The second way to lose is if a player places a piece that blocks the next piece from spawning in.

<h3>Music</h3>
- On the Game Boy, there are several musical themes played. The theme for level 1 and used in the Game Boy version is often called the "Tetris Theme". It is actually a Russian dance called Korobeiniki, or "The Peddlers." Other themes include music by Johann Sebastian Bach and the Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.
